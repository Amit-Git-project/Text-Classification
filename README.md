# Text Classification Project
This project aims to demonstrate text classification using machine learning techniques. It includes a Python script for training a text classification model and a README file to provide an overview of the project.

# Overview
Text classification is the task of assigning predefined categories or labels to textual data. In this project, we use the scikit-learn library to perform text classification on the 20 newsgroups dataset. The dataset contains approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned across 20 different newsgroups, covering a wide range of topics.
